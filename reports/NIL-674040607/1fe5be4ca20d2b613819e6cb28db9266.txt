Jett BlackheartToday at 8:10 PM
tnx
GE was just pissing me off with their stupidity
I did my best to lock shit down
 
CedronToday at 8:11 PM
It's literally the reason why our crew banded together external to government influence
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:11 PM
but I was constantly slapped down and told to leave people alone
the same people that got planets stolen out from under them
 
CedronToday at 8:12 PM
Yeah, Neria and her antics in CorSec
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:12 PM
Yeah
I am not quite sure why the Emperor allowed CORSEC to be exempt from ISB inspections
but once again another fuck up that became my problem
 
CedronToday at 8:13 PM
Seele is emotionally driven and doesn't adhere strictly to good policy
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:14 PM
I am well aware
He allows certain people to get away with whatever they want
and shit like CORSEC happens
If he would have just listened to me
I would have that faction locked down like Fort Knox
but anyway it just became so fucking annoying
and then he started getting on me
saying I was creating a hostile work environment
because some personnel who were hanging out in enemy Discord channels were complaining about how I blacklisted a bunch of people
They were successfully driving a wedge between the Emperor and I
The last straw when I got information that Darth Draxes was hanging out in enemy channels
I made a comment that I wonder why people like him hanging out in enemy channels never provide intelligence information to Imperial Intelligence
He said maybe because you have created an environment where they do not feel they can come to ISB or II
which is complete BS
Anyway that was the final comment that made me decide to say fuck off
 
CedronToday at 8:21 PM
wow
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:23 PM
Anyway that is why I left
 
CedronToday at 8:25 PM
how many credits were in GE's account and what was their income like?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:25 PM
Imperial Intelligence has a separate budget
I controlled that for II and ISB
 
CedronToday at 8:28 PM
was it a lot?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:28 PM
300 million
 
CedronToday at 8:28 PM
monthly?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:28 PM
yes
I had no access to any of the Imperial funds outside of our budget
 
CedronToday at 8:29 PM
not even view priv?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:30 PM
I did have view
and last I looked we were over a hundred billion
I never really paid attention to it honestly
 
CedronToday at 8:31 PM
damn, that's a lot of money
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:31 PM
I do know that I was asking for an increase in our budget
and Seele said because we were making good money it would not be an issue
I was in the process of having my 2IC do a budget breakdown so we could justify more funds
so I think they are bringing in a good income monthly
 
CedronToday at 8:33 PM
What major projects did II have? I hope you don't mind me asking these things, I just thrive in information.
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:34 PM
The big projects right now are providing intelligence support for Corellian Sector while they unfuck themselves
 
CedronToday at 8:35 PM
the Moff and support elements out there suck?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 8:35 PM
and also we have personnel and a task force in Hosnian
Ruby Region sucked
but they are getting unfucked now with the assistance of development SMEs

Jett BlackheartToday at 9:02 PM
Oh before I forget to tell you
GE is getting ready to have a military ball in Kuat
I am not sure if it will have people actually attending or if it will all be RP
 
CedronToday at 9:03 PM
are there any access vectors that you know of?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:03 PM
I have to find out more about it
it was just announced
and invitations were supposed to be going out
of course I will not be getting mine
but I may be able to elicit some information on it
 
CedronToday at 9:04 PM
the idea of you turning it into a Red Ball is entertaining
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:05 PM
lol
It is going to be funny watching II fall apart now
When I took it over
 
CedronToday at 9:06 PM
they were quick to remove your name from the site
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:07 PM
it was completely broken
 
CedronToday at 9:07 PM
almost like Seele is proud of it
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:07 PM
Yeah
He probably was glad I left
because I made him and Inwe look like shit
they did nothing in Intelligence
I got Operations going again which were non-existent
 
CedronToday at 9:08 PM
it felt that way for a long time
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:08 PM
Analysis had been shut down
 
CedronToday at 9:08 PM
I remember Ridgeway actually being somewhat active years ago
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:08 PM
Inwe did not think Analysis was important
 
CedronToday at 9:08 PM
he gave it a legitimate chance
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:09 PM
He was an idiot as well honestly
 
CedronToday at 9:09 PM
yes, but he tried
much better than nothing
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:09 PM
He talked to people
but he never documented anything
so all the information he got was never entered into the database
 
CedronToday at 9:10 PM
which means it was never officially collected
there's a storage/archival piece that needs to take place during collection
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:10 PM
I was wondering why things I gave him that were important never even made leadership blink and eye
they were never getting it
Seele said one time that Inwe was the best Director Imperial Intelligence has ever had
I know he said it to piss me off
 
CedronToday at 9:11 PM
lol
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:12 PM
because I got shit working that she never even attempted to fix
 
CedronToday at 9:12 PM
like what?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:12 PM
We had one contracted agent at the time I got there
now there are over 30
 
CedronToday at 9:13 PM
is that a mix of infiltrators and in-house analysts?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:13 PM
infiltrators
that does not take into account those working for analysis
and ISB as well
which is why I had to put in for a budget increase
to pay all of these people
 
CedronToday at 9:14 PM
damn, that is effective as shit
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:15 PM
Inwe had eliminated analysis, DMI, Inquisition
The entire analysis Bureau
Now they are all back up and running
but we will see if the personnel left behind can hang
I doubt it
 
CedronToday at 9:16 PM
were they all aimed at the GA?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:17 PM
A good majority of them are
but with NR now working with Trade Federation
I was considering infiltration there as well
in GC
 
CedronToday at 9:18 PM
where were some of the few special case infiltrators? places like Zann?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:20 PM
Zaan, Krath, Cooperative, Resistance, NR, Flower Company off the top of my head
Had trouble with Eidola
they are a hard nut
 
CedronToday at 9:20 PM
it's the way they're designed
they're an organization of independent people
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:21 PM
nods
I have not really seen or heard anything on them for awhile
since Hosnian
which I was not Director then
You know a guy named Kolarr?
by chance
He is about to get rolled up in GE
 
CedronToday at 9:24 PM
i do not
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:25 PM
He was detected taking screenshots of our forums and website
It somehow logged his activity
not real sure how
 
CedronToday at 9:25 PM
holy shit, that's smart
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:26 PM
but ISB was getting ready to take him into custody
 
CedronToday at 9:26 PM
probably uses javaScript to detect "keydown" on print screen
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:26 PM
yeah not sure
but they even had a picture of the screenshots
I saw one of them but on discord it was too small to really make out
 
CedronToday at 9:27 PM
okay... i can appreciate that from my day job perspective...
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:27 PM
I asked for a new one but I did not get it before I left
I would love to know how they did it
 
CedronToday at 9:27 PM
javaScript
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:28 PM
and it is good for any potential infiltrators to know they will get burned
 
CedronToday at 9:28 PM
that's extremely valuable, i'll definitely not share that with ANYONE
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:32 PM
They have a couple of smart people working the website and forums I guess
I think Vaan is pretty computer smart as well
He is they guy that took my place
Another thing that is going to weaken the GE is their upcoming realignment
they are going to move some things around but Seele is getting ready to do one of the dumbest things I have ever heard suggested
he is going to do a spill and fill for positions
I told him II needed to be excluded do to sensitivity and he said no
they will participate as well
 
CedronToday at 9:36 PM
lol
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:36 PM
So there is a good chance II will lose a lot in this
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:37 PM
He was going to make me fill out an application for my own position
and if you do not do it you are not considered
 
CedronToday at 9:37 PM
...
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:37 PM
I did not have the time for that stupid shit
so that is what is going on in GE
 
CedronToday at 9:38 PM
lol, sorry, i'm laughing in real life on the other end here
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:38 PM
while II is doing very well the rest of GE is sucking because Seele is an asshole
they are leaving in droves
so they have to scale back
I do not have anyone leaving my unit
well did not
They all liked having me as Director
they were all upset when I left
I actually stuck up for my agents and took care of them
 
CedronToday at 9:40 PM
maybe you could perform a mass exodus of their operators
or you and I find a way to bankroll them for our own network
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:40 PM
Well they are still loyal to GE
All of the guys I hand selected have been with GE the entire time in Combine
they are extremely loyal
 
CedronToday at 9:41 PM
Are there any infiltrator names you're comfortable with giving to me?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:42 PM
to the point when I was getting pissed at the end I had to watch what I said :slight_smile:
I do not know any of the infiltrators
I know you are like wtf
I designed it so the only individual who knows the actual identities was the Bureau Chief of Operations
 
CedronToday at 9:44 PM
to keep top-level hands out of his pot
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:44 PM
he would just refer to them by their number
I designed it because I know how Combine works lol
 
CedronToday at 9:45 PM
affiliations change like weather
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:45 PM
The only agents I do know are the active ones
but all they are is handlers
Handlers communicate by email
no Darkness is allowed
to protect both their identity and that of the contracted agent
the full time agent only knows their number
 
CedronToday at 9:48 PM
so you have activity reports that relate to id numbers?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:49 PM
Yes they are logged in our Imperial Intelligence database
For example
Operations gets intelligence that NR is going to assist TF in Rakku
that report is sent from the active agent to the Bureau Chief of Operations
The Bureau Chief screens the information and redacts anything that will compromise the contracted agent
they he logs the report into the switchgate
the Bureau Chief of Analysis has access to the switchgate
He takes the raw information and disseminates it to the appropriate desk to an analyst
who they analyzes the data and decides if it is garbage or actual intelligence
The final product is then listed under the appropriate file for use as intelligence
We also have the Department of Military Intelligence
who has a Chief working in analysis
they get all of the information in from the military intelligence analysts working directly in the military
Anything force related gets reported to the Chief of Inquisition
who will then get clearance to share that information with the Order of the Sith
 
CedronToday at 9:57 PM
sounds efficient
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:58 PM
It allows Operations to communicate and provide information to analysis without compromising sensitive operational information
Veselov is the current Bureau Chief of Operations
Imperial Special Operations Command or ISOC is in the process of being stood up
 
CedronToday at 9:59 PM
so each military element has a Chief of Analysis who forwards reports to the switchgate as well?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 9:59 PM
no
each military region has an intelligence officer assigned
he gets the reports and sends them back to the Chief of DMI
who then provides them to the appropriate desks
ISB has their own forums as well set up in much the same manner
but I honestly paid little attention
my 2IC was the former Bureau Chief of ISB so he handled that mostly
mostly all related to GE personnel files
tracking prisoners
and a lot of other administrative information
information on NAT inspections

CedronToday at 10:04 PM
policing
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:04 PM
yep
That is ran by Patrick Bisson
oh and Bureau Chief of Analysis is Navarro De Molay
I think Kathleen Tate who just came back from inactivity is handling DMI
but who knows how long she will be around
Peares is the Chief of Inquisition
I know Veselov is in the process of setting up system searches
I am not sure where he decided on, but he was getting all of the ships loaded when I departed
They also had to get builders as well
 
CedronToday at 10:13 PM
where is Draelor positioned?
is he over there still?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:13 PM
I fucking hate that guy
He is in charge of the money
 
CedronToday at 10:13 PM
all the money?
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:14 PM
yeah
he is the guy that renews my budget each month
He acted like he was on the same level as me
I told him one time the only people higher than me are the Executor and Emperor so watch your step
I had requisitioned an unused SSD for my DDIR since every other member of IHC has one
he also manages inventory
When he saw me assign it he jumped me and unassigned it and said I would need approval
I threatened to close some of the things I was having him do for II
in the end I just stopped talking to him because the Emperor never backed me up
once again
 
CedronToday at 10:20 PM
you mentioned that Veselov is about to do a system search
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:20 PM
yeah
 
CedronToday at 10:20 PM
I know that Draelor is gearing up for one as well
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:20 PM
they are not related
this one was being planned by Veselov
He was looking at some of the areas that have not had systems discovered yet
but he was not decided when I left
 
CedronToday at 10:21 PM
Deep space and uncontrolled sectors are considered territory for all government, mercenary, bounty hunter, and pirate factions.
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:21 PM
it was still being discussed
yeah
 
CedronToday at 10:22 PM
there's a small vector to possibly angle Draelor in
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:22 PM
Well I hope you get Draelor
Plus it will be another chance to show Seele he has no control over his fucking people
He just drove away an Imperial Officer threatening him because he is IHC
and it had nothing to do with work
it had to do with his stupid faction
 
CedronToday at 10:25 PM
Chimaera Consulting
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:25 PM
Draelor is not a member of IHC
he would have you believe that
He is allowed in the same room for situational awareness but he was not a voting member
only Branch heads are official members of IHC
 
CedronToday at 10:26 PM
https://www.swc-empire.com/ing/general/ihc
maybe it's recent, but he's Minister of Interior
 
Jett BlackheartToday at 10:27 PM
So Grand Vizier, Navy, Army, II, Sith, and government
that is IHC
